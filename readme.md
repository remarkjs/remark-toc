[**remark**][remark] plugin to generate a table of contents.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-toc
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# Alpha

## Table of Contents

## Bravo

### Charlie

## Delta
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var toc = require('remark-toc')

remark()
  .use(toc)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
# Alpha

## Table of Contents

-   [Bravo](#bravo)

    -   [Charlie](#charlie)

-   [Delta](#delta)

## Bravo

### Charlie

## Delta
```

**Note**: this example also uses `to-vfile` and `remark`, to run the example ensure all dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install to-vfile remark remark-toc
```

## API

### `remark().use(toc[, options])`

Generate a table of contents.

*   Looks for the first heading containing `'Table of Contents'`, `'toc'`,
    or `'table-of-contents'` (case insensitive, supports alt/title attributes
    for links and images too)
*   Removes all following contents until an equal or higher heading is found
*   Inserts a list representation of the hierarchy of following headings
*   Links from the table of contents to following headings, using the same slugs
    as GitHub

> **Note**: if you’re later compiling to HTML, you still need to add anchors to
> headings.
> Previously that was done by this plugin as well, but now you must
> [`.use(slug)` to include `remark-slug`][slug] explicitly.

##### `options`

All options are passed to [`mdast-util-toc`][util], with the exception that
`heading` defaults to `'toc|table[ -]of[ -]contents?'`.

## Security

Use of `remark-toc` involves user content and changes the tree, so it can open
you up for a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack.

Existing nodes are copied into the table of contents.
The following example shows how an existing script is copied into the table of
contents.

The following Markdown:

```markdown
# Table of Contents

## Bravo<script>alert(1)</script>

## Charlie
```

Yields:

```markdown
# Table of Contents

-   [Bravo<script>alert(1)</script>](#bravoscriptalert1script)
-   [Charlie](#charlie)

## Bravo<script>alert(1)</script>

## Charlie
```

This may become a problem if the Markdown is later transformed to
[**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast]) or opened in an unsafe Markdown viewer.
